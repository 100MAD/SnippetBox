// You don’t need to use justinas/alice package, but the reason I recommend it is because it makes it easy
// to create composable, reusable, middleware chains — and that can be a real help as your
// application grows and your routes become more complex. The package itself is also small and
// lightweight, and the code is clear and well written.
